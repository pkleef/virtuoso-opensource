This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License (see
[COPYING](COPYING.md)).

Note that the only valid version of the GPL license as far as this project
is concerned is the original GNU General Public License Version 2, dated

### OpenSSL exemption
This project may be compiled/linked with the OpenSSL library. If so, the
following exemption is added to the above license:

    In addition, as a special exemption, OpenLink Software gives
    permission to link the code of its release of Virtuoso with the
    OpenSSL project's "OpenSSL" library (or with modified versions
    of it that use the same license as the "OpenSSL" library), and
    distribute the linked executables. You must obey the GNU General
    Public License in all respects for all of the code used other
    than "OpenSSL".


### Client Protocol Driver exemptions

    In addition, as a special exemption, OpenLink Software gives
    permission to use the unmodified client libraries (ODBC, JDBC,
    ADO.NET, OleDB, Jena, Sesame and Redland providers) in your own
    application whether open-source or not, with no obligation to use
    the GPL on the resulting application. In all other respects you
    must abide by the terms of the GPL.
